# Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and is designed to help me practice and demonstrate my skills in the following areas:

- **HTML**: Structuring web pages with semantic HTML elements.
- **Git**: Managing version control, including creating repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories.
- **Command Line**: Navigating the file system and using Git commands via the terminal.
- **Markdown**: Writing documentation using Markdown syntax.

By the end of this project, I will have built a simple recipe website that showcases my understanding of these foundational web development skills.
